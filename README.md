# Guessing Game

Welcome to the Guessing Game! This is a simple web-based game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range. The game is built using JavaScript and uses `prompt` for user input and `Math.random()` for generating random numbers.

## Features

- Random number generation between a specified range.
- User interaction via prompts and alerts.
- Feedback on guesses indicating whether they are too high, too low, or correct.
- Attempts tracking and display of the number of attempts.
- Option to start a new game after guessing correctly.

## How It Works

1. **Generate a Random Number**: A random number is generated between a defined minimum and maximum range.
2. **Prompt User Input**: The user is prompted to guess the number.
3. **Provide Feedback**: The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
4. **Track Attempts**: The number of attempts is tracked and displayed upon a correct guess.
5. **Replay Option**: After a correct guess, the user is asked if they want to play again.
